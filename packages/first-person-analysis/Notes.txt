Trying to product composited frame output for multiple points:

Basic shader solution for additive composites here:
C:\Users\kgoulding\Documents\Development\JavaScript\GitHub\three.js\examples-kg\overlay.html

Idea is to render e.g. 48 frames where each frame's r,g,b values are divided by 48
then added to the previous frame

this might work, but there is a posterization effect that happens because the floats are rounded
into RGB bytes at each pass so you lose fractions...

one option might be to allow pngdb style addition and keep the channels separate using an indexed offset...
